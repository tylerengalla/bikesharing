# Overview
Explore NYC Citi bike data using Tableau with a goal of letting our investors know if opening a similar venture in Des Moines, Iowas is a good idea. To do this we took a CSV file of all rides in August of 2019 and created visualizations to better understand how the business operates. 

# Results

Total rides in August were 2+ million.
